        Differences Between map,filter,forEach,find in JavaScript
      </h3>
      <div>
        <h4>map:</h4>
        <p>
          The map method creates a new array with the results of calling a
          provided function on every element in the original array. The map
          method doesn't change the original array. <br />
          Example:
        </p>
        <pre>
        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        const mappedArr = arr.map((num) => num * 2);
        console.log(mappedArr); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
      </pre
        >
      </div>

      <h4>filter:</h4>
      <p>
        The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the
        test implemented by the provided function. The filter method doesn't
        change the original array.<br />
        Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const filteredArr = arr.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0);
        console.log(filteredArr); // Output: [2, 4]
        </pre
      >
      <h4>forEach:</h4>
      <p>
        The forEach method executes a provided function once for each array
        element. The forEach method doesn't create a new array.<br />
        Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        arr.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); // Output: 1,2,3
        </pre
      >
      <h4>find:</h4>
      <p>
        The find method returns the value of the first element in the array that
        satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns
        undefined. The find method doesn't change the original array.<br />
        Example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        const foundNum = arr.find((num) => num > 3);
        console.log(foundNum); // Output: 4
        </pre
      >
      <h4>Differences between LocalStorage,SessionStorage and Cookies :</h4>
      <p>
        LocalStorage and SessionStorage are designed to store larger amounts of
        data and are accessible only by the same origin, while Cookies are
        designed for smaller amounts of data and can be accessed by any website
        that has access to them. LocalStorage is persistent and data remains
        available even after the user closes their browser, whereas
        SessionStorage is temporary and data is deleted when the user closes
        their browser. Cookies can be persistent or temporary, depending on how
        they are set up by the developer.
      </p>
      <h4>Event Loop:</h4>
      <p>
        The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows the language to
        handle multiple tasks asynchronously by using a queue to manage events.
        It continuously checks the queue for new events and processes them by
        calling any associated functions or callbacks. This allows JavaScript to
        run complex applications while remaining responsive and efficient,
        without blocking the execution of other tasks.
      </p>
      <h4>quizTimer function:</h4>
      <p>
        The quizTimer function takes one argument dismiss. The function is using
        an interval timer to update the timer count. <br />
        Here's a brief overview of what the function is doing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If dismiss is true, the function clears the timer using
          clearInterval() and returns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, the function uses setInterval() to execute a callback
          function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
        </li>
        <li>
          The callback function gets the HTML element with the ID "count" and
          updates its innerHTML to display the current count in minutes and
          seconds format. It also updates the count variable by incrementing it
          by 1 on each interval.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the count is greater than 60, the function alternates the text
          color of the timer between red-300 and red-700 every 2 seconds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>chooseQuiz function:</h4>
      <p>
        The function takes two arguments index and givenAns. The function
        updates an array called answers based on the quiz question at the given
        index and the answer given by the user.<br />
        Here's a brief overview of what the function is doing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The function first checks whether an object with the same id property
          as the quiz question at the given index already exists in the answers
          array using the find() method.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an object with the same id property exists in the answers array,
          the function finds the index of that object using a for loop and the
          splice() method to update the givenAns property of the object with the
          new answer provided by the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          If no object with the same id property exists in the answers array,
          the function pushes a new object with the quiz question at the given
          index and the new answer provided by the user to the answers array.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers() function to update
          the user interface with the updated answers array.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
